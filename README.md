This package consists of two `stylelint` configs:
- `index.js` contains the config for TypeScript files. Refer to it as
`@cid-harvard/stylelint-config` in your config.
- `css.js` contains the config for CSS files (with support for CSS modules).
Refer to it as `@cid-harvard/stylelint-config/css` in your config.

Please make sure `nps eslint` passes without errors before publishing new versions.
